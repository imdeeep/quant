I already have chills just thinking about it 🇼🇸❤️💪🏾\n\nUntil then, I’ll come back home to @wwe tomorrow night as we make history on @netflix and begin a new and exciting era. \n\nTomorrow night is dedicated to my grandfather, the High Chief Peter Maivia, my grandmother, Lia Maivia and my dad, Rocky “Soulman” Johnson and my ancestors who have ALL paved the way. \n\n~ High Chief Seiuli",
